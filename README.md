# NoDeathPlugin
NoDeathPlugin is a plugin for the ZenGine game engine used in the Gothic series from Piranha Bytes.<br>
You can use this plugin with Gothic 1, Gothic Sequel, Gothic 2 and Gothic 2 NOTR.<br>
The project uses C++23 library features. Installed Union 1.0m is required to work.

# How it works
The plugin deletes the save after death and can immediately start a new game or quit the game.<br>
This implements the popular concept of playing "No death" game runs, without manually deleting files.<br>

In menu options, you can change fade screen time (in seconds) or disable input blocking (not recommended).<br>
By default, plugin is in compatibility mode and use more engine-friendly solutions.<br>
Try to disable it if the plugin doesn't work as expected.<br>

**NOTE: By default, the game does not delete saves, and you need to enable it in the options.**<br>
